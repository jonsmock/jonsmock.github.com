I'm a software (developer|engineer|person) in Williamsport, PA. My wife and I
moved here in 2007. We love this city and want to see it thrive.

I drink [Alabaster Coffee](http://www.alabastercoffee.com) and serve as the
treasurer for [City Alliance Church](http://cityalliance.org).  We are fanatical
budgeters, so ask us about it!

If you're into Twitter, I am [@jonsmock](http://twitter.com/jonsmock). I have
some of my work on [Github](https://github.com/jonsmock).

Many thanks to [John Otander](http://johnotander.com) for this awesome
[theme](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll).
